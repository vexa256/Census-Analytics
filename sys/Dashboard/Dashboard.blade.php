            <h3>What is a Census</h3>
            <p>A census is the procedure of systematically calculating,
                acquiring and recording information about the members of a given
                population. This term is used mostly in connection with national
                population and housing censuses; other common censuses include
                the census of agriculture, and other censuses such as the
                traditional culture, business, supplies, and traffic censuses.
            </p>

            <h3>What challenge does CAIS Address</h3>
            <p>Currently, the Ugandan government collects census data and
                analyzes it using a variety of technologies. These technologies,
                like CS-PRO and MS-EXCEL, aren't built for this purpose,
                resulting in inefficiency and delays in data collecting,
                processing, and presentation. This delay can be measured in
                years in some circumstances. Because statistics are continually
                out of date, this has a significant impact on their accuracy.
                <strong>CAIS is designed to serve as an demonstration of a
                    concept that the Ugandan government can adopt and
                    considerably develop in order to address the aforementioned
                    challenge.
                </strong>

            </p>

            <h3>How does CAIS demonstrate a solution to the challenge</h3>
            <p>CAIS is a web application that allows users to collect and
                analyze data in real time while maintaining security and
                scalability. By deploying CAIS on appropriate and capable
                infrastructure, it can be expanded to a national level.</p>
